# Information-Retrieval-Project
In This Project, I started to work around with whoosh, scikit-learn and some preprocessing methods for NLP on
persian poems data.                                           

You should first install scikit-learn and hazm library for tokenizing and normalizing the data.                                
after running the cells you can get your queries in query sample folder and replace it with the query variable then you get the 10 top score matches of that query.

I tried to use Naive bayes, KNN and SVM for Classification and showing the results although its a little bit slow!
